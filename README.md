## Personal Info
My name is Brian Bell, and I was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. I moved to Brisbane, Australia to pursue my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering. Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong passion for mechanics of materials, numerical modeling, CAD, and tackling coding challenges.

I fervently believe in delivering high-quality results, and have a strong desire to continuously improve my skills, knowledge, and value. While I am still refining my long term career goals, I aim to contribute to innovative engineering projects that challenge my abilities. I am eager to demonstrate my ability, and I look forward to collaborating with a dynamic engineering team to drive the success of meaningful projects


## Project Showcase

### Project 1: Critical Analysis and Refinement of the Small Punch Test

#### Project Overview
Currently in progress, this project aims to study and enhance a materials testing method known as The Small Punch Test (SPT). Broadly, this research pertains to the development and transition between internal stress states that emerge throughout a small punch test. The specific focus is on specimen response behavior at different loading stages for a range of materials with varying ductility. The small punch tests inherent sensitivit to ductility entails prospective use to accurately track operational damage to engineering systems. To better understand relevant SPT behavior mechanisms a Finite Element Model is developed and analysed. This is used hand in hand with experimental data and theoretical SPT analysis methods to critically analyze the contemporary definitions of a specimens behavior throughout a small punch test. The desired outcome, on a small scale, is to develop a more reliable toolset (FEA model included) to conduct small punch testing. On a broader scale, the project aims to reduce waste, and cost, in maintaining engineering systems

#### My Role
I am developing this project at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), under the supervision of Dr. Stuart Bell. As the sole student stakeholder I am responsible for gathering or producing reference material, developing the FEA model, and analyzing all results. In Addition, Im responsible for maintaining consistent communication with my supervisor, as well presenting and definding ongoing findings to a panel of QUT professors. 

#### Technical Skills
- Ansys Parametric Design Language
- Ansys Mechanical
- Gathering Experimental Data by performing Small Punch Tests

#### Challenges & Solutions

#### Outcome/Results
The project is still in progress. So far a Finite Element Model has been developed which can output results quantitatively similar to materials with moderate ductility. The next step is to broaden the functional data set to brittle and highly ductile materials. Subsequently the propagation of stress regimes will be studies for a number of materials with varying ductility.
